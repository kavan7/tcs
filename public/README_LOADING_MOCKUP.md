starbucks_loading_mockup.svg

Description
-----------
A modern, Starbucks-inspired loading screen mockup inside a phone outline. This SVG intentionally avoids using the official Starbucks logo or trademarked artwork — it uses original coffee-cup glyphs and a green gradient palette evocative of the brand aesthetic.
